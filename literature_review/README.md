# Literature Review Directory

This directory has the following files:
- main.tex file (lastname_lit_review_main.tex) 
- bib file (lastname_lite_review_bibliography.bib) 
- All necessary latex files to compile your lit review (e.g., style files) 
- A .zip file of the original format downloaded from the TaiLab GoogleDrive

DO NOT push the supplementary files (e.g., .aux, .pdfs, .bbl) generated by latex (use gitignore). Dr. Samavi will compile the latex document so the supplementary files are not needed

Sub-directories:
- feedback: Dr. Samavi's feedback (usually in .pdf)
- figures: figures used in literature review (.pdf or .tiff)
- final: final comprehensive proposal pdf (lastname_comprehensive_final.pdf)
- sections: the section .tex files are stored here
