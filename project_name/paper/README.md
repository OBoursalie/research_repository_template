# Paper Directory

You will add the following files to this directory:
- main.tex file (lastname_conference_acronymn_main.tex) 
- bib file (lastname_ conference_acronymn_bibliography.bib) 
- All conference/journal supplied latex files necessary to compile your paper (e.g., style files) 
- A .zip file of the original conference/journal format

DO NOT push the supplementary files (e.g., .aux, .pdfs, .bbl) generated by latex (use gitignore). Dr. Samavi will compile the latex paper so the supplementary files are not needed

Sub-directories:
- camera_ready: camera_ready paper pdf (lastname_conferenceacronymn_camera_ready.pdf)
- feedback: Dr. Samavi's feedback (usually in .pdf)
- figures: figures used in paper (.pdf or .tiff)
- presentation: presentation files (.ppt)
- published: final paper pdf (lastname_conferenceacronymn_published.pdf)
- r0_submission: first revision feedback and action plan (.xlsx), authors response (.doc), and revised paper (lastname_conferenceacronymn_published.pdf). Note: You will have multiple r_submissions in this folder for each stage of revisions
- sections: the section .tex files are stored here
