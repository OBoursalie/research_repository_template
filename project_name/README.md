# Paper Directory

This directory is for papers. Code, data and paper are the main folders. DATA SHOULD NOT BE PUSHED to git (use gitignore to not push files in the data folder). All paper versions (drafts, camera-ready, R0-R# submissions, and final) are stored in the paper directory. 

Make a new directory for each paper.

RENAME this directory for each paper. Do not use conference acronyms as the venue may change. 

Keep all .gitkeep and .gitignore files. You can include other paths to the .gitignore file based on your needs.
