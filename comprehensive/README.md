# Comprehensive Directory

You will add the following files to this directory:
- main.tex file (lastname_comprehensive_main.tex) 
- bib file (lastname_comprehensive_bibliography.bib) 
- All necessary latex files to compile your paper (e.g., style files) 
- A .zip file of the original format downloaded from the TaiLab GoogleDrive

DO NOT push the supplementary files (e.g., .aux, .pdfs, .bbl) generated by latex (use gitignore). Dr. Samavi will compile the latex document so the supplementary files are not needed

Sub-directories:
- feedback: Dr. Samavi's feedback (usually in .pdf)
- figures: figures used in comprehensive proposal (.pdf or .tiff)
- final: final comprehensive proposal pdf (lastname_comprehensive_final.pdf)
- presentation: presentation files (.ppt)
- sections: the section .tex files are stored here
