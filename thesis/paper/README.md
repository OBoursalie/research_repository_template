# Thesis Directory

This directory has the following files:
- main.tex file (lastname_thesis_main.tex) 
- bib file (lastname_thesis_bibliography.bib) 
- All supplied latex files necessary to compile your paper (e.g., style files) 
- A .zip file of the thesis format (please check TMU for most recent files, TaiLab Google Drive may also have them)

DO NOT push the supplementary files (e.g., .aux, .pdfs, .bbl) generated by latex (use gitignore). Dr. Samavi will compile the thesis so the supplementary files are not needed

Sub-directories:
- chapters: the chapter .tex files are stored here
- feedback: Dr. Samavi's feedback (usually in .pdf)
- figures: figures used in paper (.pdf or .tiff)
- presentation: presentation files (.ppt)
- published: final paper pdf (lastname_thesis_published.pdf)
