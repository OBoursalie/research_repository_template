# Thesis Directory

This directory is for your thesis. Code, data and paper are the main folders. DATA SHOULD NOT BE PUSHED to git (use gitignore to not push files in the data folder). All paper versions (drafts, camera-ready, R0-R# submissions, and final) are stored in the paper directory. 

Keep all .gitkeep and .gitignore files. You can include other paths to the .gitignore file based on your needs.
