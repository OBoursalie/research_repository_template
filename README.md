# TAILab Research Repository

A template repository for reporting research conducted in the TAILab. The repository contains:

- comprehensive: Files for the comprehensive exam (.tex)
- literature_review: Files for the literature review (.tex)
- meetings_committee: Annual committee meeting presentations (.ppt and .pdf)
- meetings_supervisor: Meeting minutes and presentations for meetings with Dr. Samavi (.txt and .ppt)
- project_name: Each paper has its own project_name folder (please rename for each paper), do not use a conference name since the venue may change (.tex)
- proposals: Each proposal (e.g., M.A.Sc, Ph.D., and grant proposals) is a subdirectory of proposals
- published: the final pdf versions for all completed work (.pdf)

Ignore files from being pushed to GitHub using a .gitignore file and always ignore files in the data directory to be commited to git. The sample .gitignore files are good starting points.
